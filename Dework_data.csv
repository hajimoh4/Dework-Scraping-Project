I advice to work for a pfp NFT
Pfp for Citydao memberwhat is the idea?
We need to airdrop or mint a set of pfp NFT for the community for free.why is it valuable towards CityDAO's larger mission?
We want to build a city on the chain, so it is inseparable from the Metaverse. First of all, we must have a business card pfp of the city. Pfp itself can be used as a good publicity business card, and at the same time bring liquidity to the community, so as to be able to expand the community. In this way, the community can feel citydao's recognition of og or holders, and at the same time increase the cohesion and stickiness of the community. This will support our larger goalswhy is it valuable to do now?
According to my observation, the community lacks vitality and cohesion now, we need to catch up with the pace of web3, let everyone feel our work, we have been working hard to build, have been building, instead of letting it develop at will. Doing so will immediately activate the community first, and eventually attract more people to help build the community.what kind of work does the idea need?We need to find an artist, not necessarily very famous. As long as the products we make have characteristics and can do good publicity, and everyone is willing to use them as avatars, they can play a great role; 2. Find a designer to express the product. Make the code, optimize the contract, and follow the format of 721A; 3. On the chain, free mint.what is a timeline?

This seeks to also help members achieve Level 1 status by holding 35,000 BANK and to grow by providing value to BanklessDAO.BACKGROUNDMarketing Guild receives different types of campaign requests on a weekly basis. At the moment, it is not clear how to differentiate them in order to link the work needed to be done, to the members that have the ability to do so. Some require vast previous experience, while others are more of an entry-level. By defining different categories, we can clearly understand what skills are needed to lead it, how the team that works on it is remunerated, and from where. This proposal aims to bring clarity to all new members and existing ones, about the opportunities available at the guild and what is expected from each campaign to maintain the quality of deliverables.The whole document can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_Z7zbt2Cb-u0ZLafTR7YufltGtvo0rLIA92cD5HXqc/editView more...","{""OrnellaWeb3 created this taskJun 7, 2022 6:48 PM"",""Mr. V üè¥ changed the status toDoneJun 19, 2022 2:14 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaJun 19, 2022 2:16 PM""}","{""Write Proposal"",""Post proposal in #marketing-governance"",""Edit document"",""Make available for feedback for 3 days"",""Create a poll"",""Discuss in the meeting""}"

The goal is to clearly illustrate the steps involved in using anyCall, including:The deposit functionThe anyCall functionThe transfer of data and fees between chainsThe infographic should be clear and concise, making it easy for users to understand the anyCall process. The target audience for this infographic is developers, product managers and other end-users who want to learn about anyCall.Deliverables:A high-quality infographic in PNG or SVG formatSource files in a vector format (e.g., Adobe Illustrator or SVG)A short explanation of the infographic in markdown or HTML formatRequirements:The infographic should be clear, concise, and visually appealingThe infographic should accurately represent the anyCall process, including the deposit function, the anyCall function, and the transfer of data and fees between chains.Use color and graphics to clearly convey informationInclude the AnyCall logo and Multichain brandingProvide both the infographics and source files in the specified formatsFurther Information:anyCall provides a seamless way to interact with different blockchains, without having to worry about the technical details of fees and gas costs.The deposit function: This function allows you to deposit funds (fees) onto the destination chain, so that when you make an anyCall, the fees are paid from the funds you've already deposited.The anyCall function: This is the main function of anyCall, which allows you to transfer data and perform actions on another blockchain. You can specify whether the fees for the anyCall should be paid on the source chain or the destination chain, depending on your needs.The transfer of data and fees between chains: With anyCall, you can transfer data and perform actions on another blockchain, while also specifying how fees should be paid. The deposit function allows you to deposit fees onto the destination chain, so that the fees can be taken from there, rather than from your own wallet on the source chain.Further Technical Information:The deposit function is used in anyCall to deposit fees on the destination chain, which is required when you want to pay for gas fees on the destination chain (as opposed to the source chain). The deposit function takes a single argument, which is the address of the account on the destination chain that you want to deposit fees for. When the deposit function is called, it updates the execution budget for the specified account, adding the amount of the deposit.The anyCall function is the main function in anyCall that enables cross-chain communication and transfers data and fees between chains. The anyCall function takes several arguments, including the address of the destination contract, the data to be sent to the destination contract, the ID of the destination chain, and a set of flags that determine how fees are paid and fallback behavior. When the anyCall function is called, it sends the specified data to the destination contract and handles the transfer of fees and data between the source and destination chains.The transfer of data and fees between chains is a key aspect of anyCall , as it enables communication between contracts on different blockchain networks. When the anyCall function is called, it transfers the data specified in the call to the destination contract and handles the transfer of fees between the source and destination chains based on the flags specified in the call. If fees are to be paid on the destination chain, the deposit function is called to deposit the required fees before the anyCall function is executed. If fees are to be paid on the source chain, the anyCall function calculates the necessary fees and includes them in the transaction.View more...","{""RRazor0x / Finanzgoblin created this taskFeb 9, 2023 6:32 PM"",""MultiDAO changed the reward to 200 POCSTFeb 10, 2023 1:16 PM""}","{n/a}"

The interface will be hosted in multichaindao.orgThere are currently a few issues making it difficult to trade veMULTI :(1) There are 3 blockchains that veMULTI can exist on, namely Ethereum, Fantom and BNB chain. Each chain has NFT marketplaces, each with its own formats, so it can be difficult to compare prices and value between them.(2) A veMULTI is created with MULTI, which can be added whenever the user wishes to do so. These additions are NOT reflected in the current NFT marketplaces.(3) Over time the veMULTI reduces unless the user renews the lock time. Once again this is not reflected in current NFT marketplaces. The purchaser does not know what the veMULTI value is compared to the amount of locked MULTI.The front-end solution we are seeking will eliminate all of these problems. The user should be able to select one of the chains and then every veMULTI for sale on that chain in each NFT marketplace will be listed in a common format, with a link to take them to it.Each veMULTI entry should display the current number of MULTI locked as well as the time of expiry and the number of veMULTI remaining.The current asking price in the applicable gas token should be displayed. Using an appropriate swap pair on the main Dexes, the USD price should also be shown, as well as the ratio of the value of the asking price to the locked MULTI value.A simple link should open another window to allow the user to make an offer, or purchase the NFT. All major NFT marketplaces should be included and the code should allow additional ones to be added in a straightforward way.The interface should allow both MetaMask and Wallet Connect to be supported.The front end should be coded in React and Typescript, using the ethers library, using the style sheet developed for the MultiDAO website.RemindersÔºöPlz, contact (@marcelsecu) on TG, before u start the work.View more...","{""MultiDAO created this taskApr 6, 2023 10:55 AM"",""MultiDAO added P paddyc1  to assigneesMay 4, 2023 12:51 PM""}","{n/a}"

Join us on Discord!#Print File TemplatesBack PrintFront PrintSleeve Print (optional)#File requirements#Tips for best resultsAvoid semi-transparent designsSemi-transparent graphics (or elements with lowered opacity) don't translate well in DTG printing. We advise using solid colors or simulating semi-transparency by halftoning (for more information, see printful‚Äôsvideo tutorial).Create designs with the necessary DPISimply typing in a new resolution value into the file won't result in a higher resolution print. If your graphic's resolution is too low, the best solution is to recreate it.Use transparency to your advantageBlack ink will appear gray on black garments because of the white underbase used during printing. Leave these areas fully transparent when designing for black garments.Avoid borders when designing sleeve printsWe advise against using graphics with perfect borders for sleeve printing, since the print can warp slightly when the sleeve is being pulled off the pallet.#Submissions open untilPlease submit your design before October 25th @ 4 pm UTCInfoWarningTipAny problems or questions?

I think some community led groups/events that are funded by small grants would help the members of the dao grow closer together, while also keeping PoolTogether on everyone‚Äôs radar/calendrer. Tjark recommended ReadTogether a PoolTogether book club focused on non-fiction books. This would be a great way to get people thinking about PoolTogether throughout their day, but would also get people discussing how the book for that month(or time period) could apply to PoolTogether. For instance if the book was on how you could better collaborate with co-workers, ReadTogether could discuss ways that we as a community could better collaborate. Ncookie also suggested BoostTogether, where we could make rocket league teams and compete on the weekends. I think this would be a great way for PoolTogether members to get to know each other better outside of working in the dao and build a strong team. If members participating also streamed it could provide a way for people interested in rocket league to be exposed to PoolTogether. Maybe users join for these special Together branded groups, but after finding out what PoolTogether is decide to make a deposit. Another suggestion I want to make is BuildTogether a Minecraft server. PoolTogether has a great community and I think it would be really cool to have that visualized as a block town, with Pool logo pixel art. If there was a addon/plugin that allowed for the exchange of crypto tokens (something like collabland), then we could possibly have a little Minecraft economy based around the POOL token. We could even advertise it a p2e (Hop on our Minecraft server find some diamonds and trade them for POOL!). Now these ideas were just examples of what I was visualizing, not a final product or suggestion by any means. I think that we should have either a discord poll or another bounty to see what people would be most interested in participating in. I know another crypto discord that plays poker occasionally.If this bounty does end up winning I think the POOL reward should either:A: Be split evenly between Tjark, Ncookie, and me.orB: Be used to start another bounty to gather ideas on what activities people would be most interested to participate in.View more...","{""Tjark üåäüèÜ created this taskMay 26, 2022 1:44 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaAug 8, 2022 4:28 PM""}","{n/a}"

Attempt being the operative word. I wrote something up at the beginning of the year in a google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QKDqvOVp1-Lxm4rFpXF8LaWw6DdnY1Xh3_IGZYK9Zw/edit?usp=sharing and I started playing with Figma to get a mock up:I think the quick take away from it all is to create an easy way for charities and creators to add their wallet to a revamped multi-delegator UI where they can be selected from a searchable dropdown. Effectively a charity or creator could add their wallet to the PoolTogether ecosystem. Then a user could then be made aware of this through the charity/creators network, randomly searching on PT, or something else. Then the user could select the charity/creator from the dropdown and assign a percentage or dollar amount to delegate. The user could go through this flow multiple times selecting multiple charities/creators before creating the delegation transaction.So there‚Äôs 2 items:A UI for charities/creators/etc. to enter their wallet, some helpful tags or keywords to search. This then gets entered into a database which is called through the multi-delegator UI.The multi-delegator is revamped to pull from the charity/creators/etc. database when a user is trying to find a delegator option.Bonus Item:An UI for the charities/creators/etc. (most likely creators) to pull all the wallets that is delegating to them. This UI would integrate the TWAB rewards contract in an easy to use way, so they could then distribute tokens/NFTs/etc. to the people that are delegating to the charity/creator/etc.This creates an opportunity for the charity/creator/etc. to create token-gated perks, special randomized drops/giveaways, etc.View more...","{""Tjark üåäüèÜ created this taskMay 26, 2022 1:44 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaAug 8, 2022 4:24 PM""}","{n/a}"

This is a great system but the notion of a probabilistic return might deter some folks who are on the lower end of the economic spectrum. An idea to improve uptake would be to have some other pools that had a scaling factor that favoured the inverse of investment similar to quadratic funding.You could set an lower bound for returns and also a higher bound. For example at the 4 USDC minimum the expected return could be something like 20% APY and then the scales work in such a way that the larger investors 100k+ have an expected APY of 2%. Theres obviously risk of gaming the system here if lower returns are too high but it would be possible to just limit this such that gas fees stop that from being a possibility. Theres also a potential that whales are less altruistic then would be required so may require some market research on minimum required return.The benefit to the protocol would be a potential improvement in uptake while also providing a small means of support and onboarding for lower economic areas.#Time based Rewards BonusIt might be helpful to add a sort of bonus for not making a withdrawal over a certain amount of time. This could be either a guaranteed return or just a slight adjustment of the odds. For example any user that hasn't withdrawn funds in 30 days gets a +1 entry or something like that.The benefit to the protocol would be  more stability in the volume of deposits (although this may not be an issue just an idea).View more...","{""Tjark üåäüèÜ created this taskMay 26, 2022 1:43 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaAug 8, 2022 4:12 PM""}","{n/a}"

For example, if you gather 1000 points and 1 BIO token would be worth 1 USDC, you will receive at least 1000 BIO tokens.Each task has a price assigned upfront.

One way to do this is by modifying the exportStoryBookLearningEventsToCsv method in the ExportEventsToCsvWorker class to include an additional column for the storybook title.You will have to update the headers of the CSV file to include the \""storybook_title\"" column. Also, you will have to make sure that the data of the storybook title is included in each row of the CSV file, alongside the other information about the StoryBookLearningEvents.Additionally, you will need to update the webapp's REST API to accept the \""storybook_title\"" column and handle it appropriately. Specifically, you should update the StoryBookLearningEventsRestController.java file and the corresponding methods to handle the storybook_title column.It's important to test the changes made to the Android code and REST API and make sure the CSV file is being exported correctly and the data is being handled correctly.It's also important to note that, If you are using a library to export the CSV file, you might need to check the documentation of the library to see if it supports adding additional columns to the CSV file, or if you need to use a different approa""}","{n/a}"

Developers at ResearchHub have noticed that the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) build time for NextJS is slow, and this is affecting our development speed and efficiency. We would like to improve the HMR build time for NextJS in order to speed up our local development process.Acceptance Criteria:Conduct an analysis of the current build process and identify bottlenecks.Implement optimizations to reduce the build time of HMR for NextJS.Measure the impact of the optimizations on the build time.Ensure that the optimizations do not negatively affect the quality or stability of the build process.Document the optimizations and any configuration changes made to the project.Ensure that the optimized build process is easy to replicate and maintain.Considerations:
The ResearchHub engineering team has many thoughts about how to optimize this process, and we would love to have a brief chat to kickstart this effort and brainstorm on the right approach before starting the work.Originally created from Github issue: https://github.com/ResearchHub/researchhub-web/issues/1396View more...","{""Github Integration created this taskMay 2, 2023 8:34 PM"",""Andrew P changed the reward to 20000 RSCMay 2, 2023 8:37 PM"",""Vector13 days agoHi, I am a senior blockchain & full-stack developer and  I am interested in this task."",""Tyler D. changed the status toIn ProgressMay 10, 2023 8:42 PM"",""Tyler D. changed the status toTo DoMay 10, 2023 8:42 PM"",""Tyler D.  removed  Tyler D. from assigneesMay 10, 2023 8:50 PM"",""Tyler D. added  Vector  to assigneesMay 10, 2023 8:57 PM"",""Tyler D. changed the status toIn ProgressMay 10, 2023 8:57 PM"",""VVector#08097 days agoUpdated HMR build time and created pull request on vector/hmr branch.""}","{n/a}"

As an academic/researcher using ResearchHub, I would like to have the option to post anonymously to the platform. This feature would enable users to post without having their profile and reputation score attached to their post, which would be useful in cases where users want to engage with literature freely without it being tied to their outside academic reputation.Requirements:[Frontend] Anonymize toggle. When posting, a user should have a toggle in the comment editor to turn anonymity on/off.
that enables them to anonymize their user profile metadata.[Backend] Anonymizing user metadata. From a backend perspective, when posting, a user will have the option to anonymize their user profile metadata.[Backend] Bounding reputation. The reputation isn't fully anonymized, instead it is rounded up to the nearest hundredth to provide confidence to other users interacting with an anonymized post that the post came from a reputable source.Considerations:In the worst case scenario where our DB is hacked, users would need assurance that data they posted is anonymous. Perhaps a hashing function approach will work here.Payment: Will need to spend RSC or stake RSC to post anonymouslyYou will need to pair up with an RH Engineer for an end-to-end implementation of this feature.Originally created from Github issue: https://github.com/ResearchHub/researchhub-backend/issues/1261View more...","{""Github Integration created this taskMay 2, 2023 8:33 PM"",""Andrew P changed the reward to 30000 RSCMay 2, 2023 8:37 PM"",""Andrew P added  serox.eth  to assigneesMay 4, 2023 9:15 PM"",""serox.eth changed the status toIn ProgressMay 5, 2023 2:14 PM"",""serox.eth12 days ago"",""Tyler D. changed the reward to 15000 RSC15000 RSCMay 17, 2023 6:41 PM"",""Tyler D. changed the reward to 30000 RSCMay 17, 2023 6:46 PM""}","{""Subtask 1: Create proposed Design + Verify Design with Core Devs"",""Subtask 2: Implement proposed design""}"

Our live feed is taking too long to load.A big part of the problem is that we're making a TON of db calls. If you look at localhost:8000/silk/ then you can view the amount of DB calls per serialization (/endpoint).We need to prefetch more of the livefeed items -- it's a generic key so I'm not sure exactly how to prefetch that but there should be a way.

We want to start building a new Distribution mechanism.The way it would work would be we put XXX RSC up for distribution for one month. We want to split that XXX RSC to each paper who have received upvotes in that month, based on upvotes. For example if we have 100 RSC, and have 2 papers -- one with 30 upvotes and one with 70, then paper 1 will receive 30 / 100 and paper 2 will receive 70 / 100 RSC.The breakdown of that RSC split will be based on submitters, authors, curators, reviewers.The submitter is the user who created the post - 10%The author is the scientist(s) who originally created the content shared within the post. - 40%The upvoters are the users who upvote a new piece of content - 20%The commenters are users who engage in discussion around a post - 15%The curators are users who create a key takeaway or add to the summary - 15%We also want to reward early upvoters & early commenters with more of the pie. So for example, if 30 people upvote paper 1, instead of giving 30 * .2 = 6 / 30 = .2 RSC to each user who upvoted, we want some sort of upvote decay process.Steemit uses a similar decay model for ""curators"".

Being alone, they struggle to raise, and with no money they struggle to attract devs.We have developed a model for sweat equity that enables the team to function effectively (seehttps://intelligent-glove-386.notion.site/Tiered-Compensation-Model-5bbcbb4584504829944d7290b981b606).Now we just need to find 1-2 developers willing to complete some bounties on the side (earning sweat equity). So we can advance the tool up to releasing the team scheduling feature and then we already have a business model and could start to generate revenue! or at least we would be in a strong position to fundraise.So, in summary, this task is about attracting 1-2 developers to work on meetwithwallet bounties for sweat equity.View more...","{""danielo created this taskDec 17, 2022 8:14 PM"",""Sandela3 months agoIs this still a need?

This will help us prevent bias and avoid missing important consideration factors. Consistency will become even more important when working with different people conducting assessments.We need to collect data from the deals we look at and the assessments we complete for those deals. We can use this data to extract insights about the opportunities we review and how we approach them.#SolutionOne way to solve the problem is to set up a deal assessment template. During the deal assessment, the VC Talent will complete this template. The template will allow the VC Talent to assess the opportunity across different criteria (quantitative and qualitative) and assign a score. The template will calculate a total score (e.g. 1-10). A high score will support a recommendation of the deal and a low score will support a rejection.We can come up with the specific criteria for the assessment together. To start with, however, let's think about the following questions:#QuestionsWhat tools can we use to implement such a template? (e.g. Google Sheets? Airtable? Notion?)How can we collect the data from these assessments, so we can easily analyze it later?How would users of the template access it and use it?View more...","{""Vic (VLK) created this taskJul 5, 2022 1:57 AM"",""Ben changed the status toIn ProgressAug 26, 2022 5:48 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaSep 8, 2022 12:24 PM"",""On-chain proof mintedView on OpenSeaSep 8, 2022 12:24 PM"",""Vic (VLK)  removed  Vic (VLK)L lp-kadek from assigneesOct 12, 2022 6:34 AM"",""Vic (VLK) added  farlos  to assigneesOct 12, 2022 6:34 AM"",""Vic (VLK) changed the status toDoneOct 12, 2022 6:34 AM""}","{n/a}"
